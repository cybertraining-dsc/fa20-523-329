Get Started in Final Project Plan

--Big Data in E-Commerce

This is an individual project, I plan to accomplish the report by myself. The topic of my report is big data in e-commerce. In my life, e-commerce is a big part of my life. During the shopping online, the recommend commodities are fitter and fitter for my liking and willingness to buy. This is the merit of big data. Big data use my purchase history and browsing history to analyze my liking and recommend the goods for me.

For the dataset, I will use the source website provided in the project requirements, if there needs more information, I will search for data and information on the web.

As Artur Olechowski wrote, &quot;According to the IDC, the digital universe of data will grow by 61% to reach a smashing 175 zettabytes worldwide by 2025. There&#39;s no denying that a large chunk of the digital world belongs to e-commerce, which takes advantage of customer social media activity, web browser history, geolocation, and data about abandoned online shopping carts. Most e-commerce businesses are able to collect and process data at scale today. Many of them leverage data analytics to understand their customers&#39; purchasing behaviors, follow the changing market trends, gain insights that allow them to become more proactive, deliver more personalized experiences to customers. The global Big Data in the e-commerce industry is expected to grow at the CAGR of 13.27% between 2019 and 2028. But what exactly is Big Data? And how can e-commerce businesses capture this powerful technology trend to their advantage? In this article, we take a closer look at the key trends in the usage of Big Data technologies by e-commerce companies and offer you some tips to help you get started in this game-changing field (Olechowski, para 1-4)&quot;.

The most common and widely used application of big data is in e-commerce. Nowadays, the application of big data in e-commerce is relatively mature. As Artur Olechowski wrote, &quot;As businesses scale up, they also collect an increasing amount of data. They need to get interested in data and its processing; this is just inevitable. That&#39;s why a data-driven e-commerce company should regularly measure and improve upon: shopper analysis, customer service personalization, customer experience, the security of online payment processing, targeted advertising （para11)&quot;.

There are also some disadvantages of the big data, or to say more need to do after getting the data. Artur Olechowski wrote, &quot;Understand the problem of security — Big Data tools gather a lot of data about every single customer who visits your site. This is a lot of sensitive information. If your security is compromised, you could lose your reputation. That&#39;s why before adopting the data technology, make sure to hire a cybersecurity expert to keep all of your data private and secure (para 41)&quot;. Security is always a big problem with big data. This is one of the components I will analyze in my report. He also wrote, &quot;Lack of analytics will become a bigger problem — Big Data is all about gathering information, but to make use of it, your system should also be able to process it. High-quality Big Data solutions can do that and then visualize insights in a simple manner. That&#39;s how you can make this valuable information useful to everyone, from managers to customer service reps (para 41)&quot;. The analysis is also an important part of the big data. Only collecting data cannot help e-commerce anything. Security and analytics will be talked in my report.

For a good report, I will look for some examples of big data in e-commerce and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the influence of big data in e-commerce. I will do more research on the pros and cons of big data in e-commerce. I will also study in the course to know more about big data.
