## Abstract

This is an individual project, I plan to accomplish the report by myself. The topic of my report is big data in e-commerce. In my life, e-commerce is a big part of my life. During the shopping online, the recommend commodities are fitter and fitter for my liking and willingness to buy. This is the merit of big data. Big data use my purchase history and browsing history to analyze my liking and recommend the goods for me.

## 1. Introduction

This section will be addressed upon project completion.

## 2. Background Research and Previous Work

As Artur Olechowski wrote, “According to the IDC, the digital universe of data will grow by 61% to reach a smashing 175 zettabytes worldwide by 2025. There’s no denying that a large chunk of the digital world belongs to e-commerce, which takes advantage of customer social media activity, web browser history, geolocation, and data about abandoned online shopping carts. Most e-commerce businesses are able to collect and process data at scale today. Many of them leverage data analytics to understand their customers’ purchasing behaviors, follow the changing market trends, gain insights that allow them to become more proactive, deliver more personalized experiences to customers. The global Big Data in the e-commerce industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.27% between 2019 and 2028. But what exactly is Big Data? And how can e-commerce businesses capture this powerful technology trend to their advantage? In this article, we take a closer look at the key trends in the usage of Big Data technologies by e-commerce companies and offer you some tips to help you get started in this game-changing field (Olechowski, para 1-4)”.
	
The most common and widely used application of big data is in e-commerce. Nowadays, the application of big data in e-commerce is relatively mature. As Artur Olechowski wrote, “As businesses scale up, they also collect an increasing amount of data. They need to get interested in data and its processing; this is just inevitable. That’s why a data-driven e-commerce company should regularly measure and improve upon: shopper analysis, customer service personalization, customer experience, the security of online payment processing, targeted advertising （para11)”.
	
There are also some disadvantages of the big data, or to say more need to do after getting the data. Artur Olechowski wrote, “Understand the problem of security — Big Data tools gather a lot of data about every single customer who visits your site. This is a lot of sensitive information. If your security is compromised, you could lose your reputation. That’s why before adopting the data technology, make sure to hire a cybersecurity expert to keep all of your data private and secure (para 41)”. Security is always a big problem with big data. This is one of the components I will analyze in my report. He also wrote, “Lack of analytics will become a bigger problem — Big Data is all about gathering information, but to make use of it, your system should also be able to process it. High-quality Big Data solutions can do that and then visualize insights in a simple manner. That’s how you can make this valuable information useful to everyone, from managers to customer service reps (para 41)”. The analysis is also an important part of the big data. Only collecting data cannot help e-commerce anything. Security and analytics will be talked about in my report.

## 3. Choice of Data-sets

QUARTERLY RETAIL E-COMMERCE SALES 2 nd QUARTER 2020:<https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf>

For the dataset, I will use the source website provided in the project requirements, if there needs more information, I will search for data and information on the web. As a result of recent COVID-19 incidents, many organizations work in a small capacity or have entirely ceased activities. The Census Bureau has tracked and analyzed the response and data quality in this manner.

I choose Monthly Retail Trade from Census. The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce today reported that the forecast of U.S. retail e-commerce revenue for the second quarter of 2020 adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, but not for price adjustments, was $211.5 billion, a rise of 31.8 per cent (±1.2 per cent) from the first quarter of 2020. Total retail revenues were projected at $1,311.0 billion for the second quarter of 2020, a decline of 3.9 percent (±0.4 percent) from the first quarter of 2020. The e-commerce forecast for the second quarter of 2020 increased (para1). 

Retail e-commerce sales are estimated from the same sample used for the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) to estimate preliminary and final U.S. retail sales. Advance U.S. online transactions are calculated from a subsample of the MRTS survey that is not of appropriate magnitude to calculate improvements in retail e-commerce transactions.

A stratified basic random sampling procedure is used to pick approximately 10,800 retailers, except food services, whose transactions are then weighted and benchmarked to reflect the entire universe of over two million retailers. The MRTS sample is focused on probability and represents all employer firms engaged in retail activities as described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Coverage covers all vendors whether or not they are active in e-commerce. Internet travel agents, financial brokers and distributors, and ticket sales companies are not listed as retail and are not included with either the gross retail or retail e‐commerce sales figures. Non employees are reflected in the projections by benchmarking of previous annual survey estimates that contain non employer revenue based on administrative data. E-commerce revenues are included in the gross monthly sales figures.

The MRTS sample is revised on a continuous basis to account for new retail employees (including those selling over the Internet), company deaths and other shifts in the retail business environment. Firms are asked to report e-commerce revenue on a monthly basis separately. For each month of the year, data for non-responsive sampling units shall be calculated from reacting sampling units falling under the same class of sector and sales size segment or on the basis of the company's historical results. Responding firms account for approximately 67% of the e-commerce sales estimate and approximately 72% of the U.S. retail sales estimate for any quarter.

Estimates are obtained by summing the weighted sales (either reported or charged) for each month of the quarter. The monthly figures are benchmarked against previous annual survey estimates. Quartal projections are determined summing up the monthly benchmarked figures. The forecast for the last quarter is a provisional forecast. The calculation is also open to revision. Data consumers who make their own projections using data from this study can only apply to the Census Bureau as the source of input data.

This article publishes forecasts optimized for seasonal variation and variations in holiday and trade days, but not for adjustments in rates. As feedback for the X‐13ARIMA‐SEATS programme, we have used the updated figures of quarterly figures of e-commerce revenue for the fourth quarter 1999 up to the present quarter. For revenue, we estimated the quarterly adjusted figures for each year with an additional modified monthly revenue forecast. Seasonal estimate adjustment is an approximation based on current and previous experiences.

The estimates containing sample errors and non-sample errors in this article are based on a survey.

The difference between the prediction and the results of the full population listing under the same sample conditions is the sampling error. This mistake happens when a national poll only tests a sub-set of the total population. Estimated sampling variance measurements are standard errors and variance coefficients, as stated in Table 2 of this article.

For a good report, I will look for some good examples of big data in e-commerce and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the influence of big data in e-commerce. I will do more research on the pros and cons of big data in e-commerce. I will also study in the course to know more about big data.
